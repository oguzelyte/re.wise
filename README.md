You are required to come up with an idea for a mobile app that you would like to have and implement. You can target any phone you like and can use any development environment that you chose - you can build a responsive HTML5 app if you so wish.

# Re.wise

For "re.wise" I was mainly using Firebase Authentication, Firebase Storage and Firebase Firestore. All of these services were for different purposes. Authentication was a Firebase service I used to register and log in my users. Firebase Storage was Firebaseâ€™s cloud storage to hold big files, such as: pdf, doc, img. I used it for file upload so that students using my app could share file uploads. Firebase Firestore was the most useful of them all, it worked by creating JSON file collections, which I used to save additional information about stored files, my users, study groups, universities etc.
